# Steam Proton script (modified)

This folder contains modified Python 3 _[proton](proton)_ script for Linux Steam client. It is mandatory for system-wide Wine/DXVK/D9VK to work on Steam client.

Steam client executes this script when a Steam Play compatible Windows game is launched. It hooks necessary Wine, OpenVR, DXVK (& D9VK) files for the selected game to use.

Feel free to customize the script in the limits of [LICENSE](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/blob/proton_4.2/LICENSE)
